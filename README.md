# Hours

CLI tool to quickly track hours worked on different projects throughout the day/week/month/year

I always forget to note hours worked and then my PM or Lead asks how many hours a task took and I have to try to recall my day from 2 weeks ago or guesstimate a number. Not anymore! Now when I commit my code I can also run a quick terminal command to keep track of how many hours something took.

```bash
hours new some-task
hours add some-task 4
hours get some-task
some-task: 4 hours
```

And just like that I can check to see that updating the README took 4 hours to complete.
